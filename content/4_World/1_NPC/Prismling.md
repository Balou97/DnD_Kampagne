## Profile

**Description:** 
The Prismling is a small, dog-sized celestial creature with a body covered in hard, rock-like skin that has a subtle, greyish hue. Despite its rugged exterior, the creature emanates an ethereal glow, with faint veins of light tracing across its surface, giving it an otherworldly appearance. Embedded along its back are six vibrant gemstones, each a different color, ranging from deep emerald green to brilliant sapphire blue. These gemstones pulse gently with a soft, radiant glow, standing in stark contrast to the dull grey of the Prismling's skin. Its eyes are large and expressive, resembling polished opals that catch and reflect light, adding to its mystical aura. Though its exterior appears tough, the Prismling’s presence is undeniably enchanting, as if it were a living embodiment of the earth’s hidden treasures.

The Prismling is a creature of profound empathy and gentle spirit. It is deeply attuned to the emotions and well-being of those around it, often offering comfort through its calming presence and soothing telepathic communication. Despite its small size, the Prismling carries a sense of quiet strength, always willing to expend its own energy to heal and protect those it bonds with. Its playful nature is often expressed in moments of light-hearted interaction, but there is always an underlying sense of purpose in its actions, driven by a deep connection to its celestial origins and the divine powers it serves.

The Prismling is inherently selfless, willing to sacrifice its own vitality to aid its companions. However, it does so without fear or hesitation, knowing that its true purpose lies in bringing light and healing to the world. The creature’s presence is a beacon of hope, and its radiant gems are a constant reminder of the delicate balance between life and sacrifice. Despite the potential cost of its powers, the Prismling remains unwaveringly devoted to its mission, serving as a loyal and loving companion to those it deems worthy.

## Traits

**Gem Healing.** The Prismling has six smaller, colorful gems on its back. As an action, a creature can touch one of these gems to heal for 2d8 + 4 hit points. The gem loses some of its brightness when used in this way. This ability can be used five times per long rest.

**Restorative Gem.** The Prismling has one central, larger gem. As an action, one or more creatures can touch the central gem and gain the benefits of a long rest. The central gem then turns grey. When the central gem turns grey, the Prismling dies.
