## Profile

**Description:** 
Tivilius, the Silver Tongue, is the enigmatic and calculating right hand of Dispater, the Iron Duke of Dis. With a sharp mind and a silver tongue, Tivilius is known throughout the Nine Hells as a master of intrigue and manipulation, but not of his master. Unlike other devils who rely on brute strength, Tivilius wields his words as weapons, twisting truths and bending the wills of others to serve the Iron Duke’s paranoid interests. Cloaked in an aura of authority, he enforces Dispater’s will with ruthless efficiency, carefully navigating the treacherous politics of the infernal realm.

Though his power is derived entirely from his master's favor, Tivilius is anything but a mere servant. As the Warden of Secrets and the Hand of the Iron Duke, he is entrusted with the most delicate of tasks, ensuring that the countless plots against Dispater are thwarted before they even begin. His presence is both feared and respected in the city of Dis, where whispers of his name can silence even the boldest of devils. Tivilius operates under the constant scrutiny of Dispater, aware that his position is precarious and that any misstep could lead to his swift demise. Yet, he thrives in this tension, turning it into a weapon as sharp as any blade, ensuring that he remains an indispensable asset in the paranoid lord's court.
