**Description:**Â 
"[[Chapter 0 - Introduction|The Eternal Scales: Ancient Legends and Tales]]" tells the Story of the war between Bahamut and Tiamat, that spanned more than thousand years over the entire world. However, what gets lost in this story is that many subordinates of Tiamat lost most of their powers and got forced into minor living beings. Zephyr Solvyrth is this subordinate. A former powerful Purple Dragon who lost the majority of his power and got banished into the body of a lower being, planning and waiting for his moment to break free and get his full strength once again to serve his queen Tiamat.
