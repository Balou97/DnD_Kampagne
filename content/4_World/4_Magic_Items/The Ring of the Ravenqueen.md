## Profile

**Description:** 
This silver ring features a meticulously detailed raven, its sleek form captured in relief against the polished band. The raven's wings extend gracefully, conveying a sense of swift motion frozen in time.

Crafted with fine detail, the Ring of the Ravenqueen exudes quiet mystery and subtle power. The smooth silver band places emphasis on the centerpiece: the delicately etched raven, its feathers shimmering softly with movement.

## Powers:
#### Raven´s Resilience
You can use this ring to invoke the favor of the Ravenqueen in moments of peril. When you fail a Dexterity saving throw, you can choose to succeed instead. You can use this feature up to 3 times per long rest.
