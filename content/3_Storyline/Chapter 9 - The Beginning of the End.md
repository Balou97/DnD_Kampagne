### The Assassination Attempt
After successfully escaping with the dragon's gold, the Deam celebrated late into the night in [[The Davern]], reveling in their victory. As everyone finally settled to sleep, they were suddenly attacked. [[FEND]] was alerted at the last moment by Uzgamon, the Devil in his eye. A young-looking woman had sneaked into Davern and was now attacking the group. They immediately recognized her as [[4_World/1_NPC/Tatyana|Tatyana]], the wife of [[Strahd von Zarovich]], who was abducted from him during their wedding. However, she seemed to be out of her senses, her eyes faintly glowing purple, and her expression distant.

Initially, the fight did not go well for the Deam. Uzgamon offered FEND his powers, with the condition that FEND would commit to helping him on a mission in return. At first hesitant, FEND agreed to the deal to gain the upper hand against Tatyana, signing the contract. With his newfound powers, they eventually defeated Tatyana and bound her.

It turned out she was under a powerful spell that could only be broken by the caster or upon their death. Armed with this information, they set out to consult [[Laeral Silverhand|Lady Laeral]], but before they reached her, they encountered a familiar face. [[Oathliz]], the Dragonborn Paladin from [[Springwater]], was in conversation with three huge orcs. He greeted the group and invited them to join him on an important mission. It emerged that these orcs belonged to the clan responsible for plundering and destroying [[Kahani|Kahani's]] people.

### The Sewers of Waterdeep
Joined by the orcs and Oathliz, the group was tasked with investigating the sewers of [[Waterdeep]]. Since the death of [[Artor Morlin]], the balance down there had been disrupted. The [[Zhentarim]] had apparently been driven out, and someone new now held sway. Incidents of people disappearing into the sewers had become frequent and needed to be stopped.

Upon entering the sewers, Kahani prepared an ambush against the orcs, which was foiled by his own group. Disheartened, Kahani separated from the group and sought out the last safehouse of the Zhentarim above the sewers, where he met [[Belwrick Grimwall]]. From him, Kahani learned that the Zhentarim had been completely expelled from Waterdeep, with Belwrick being the sole remaining member.

Meanwhile, the group discovered a hidden door in the sewers, not marked on any maps. Upon opening it, a massive explosion occurred, instantly pulverizing two of the three orcs and severely injuring the third.
