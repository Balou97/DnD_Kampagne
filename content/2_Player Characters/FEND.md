**Backstory:**
I was built for the sole purpose of war. The kingdom that built me was overthrown though before I could ever be activated. I was then sold off to an artificer who managed to activate me and planned to use me as a lab assistant. Over the years we began to bond, I became his pupil and he became something like a father to me. One night though, he vanished without a trace. I waited for him to return, but after a few months had passed and there was still no sign of him, I gave up and set out on an adventure to find him and figure out what happened that night..
