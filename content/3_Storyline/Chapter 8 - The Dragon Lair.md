### The Kobolds and the Dragon
On their journey back from [[Oribos]] to [[Waterdeep]], the group passed through the village of Blackwood where they encountered [[Percival Dragonheart]], who had cleverly avoided conscription. With the new member in tow, they traveled to [[Deampark]] where their [[Dremgron|kobold]] minions were supposed to be working. Finding nobody there, they promptly smoked out their tunnels. Further south, they discovered a second entrance to the tunnel system and after disabling all traps, found their kobolds transporting gold for their master.

In just one round, the kobolds were defeated, and the group continued marching towards the dragon, who slept in a vast mound of gold coins. After a long and brutal battle, they managed to momentarily incapacitate the dragon, steal the gold, and escape.

Finally arriving in Waterdeep, the group celebrated their victory, newfound wealth, and the hatching of the [[Snail_Egg.jpg|giant snail egg]].
