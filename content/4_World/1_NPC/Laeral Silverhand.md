Laeral Silverhand, known as the Lady Mage of Waterdeep, is a striking figure with an air of timeless elegance and formidable presence. She possesses long, silver hair that cascades down her back, a testament to her moniker and lineage as one of the Seven Sisters, daughters of the goddess Mystra. Her piercing blue eyes reflect both wisdom and a hint of melancholy, speaking to the centuries of knowledge and experiences she has accumulated. Clad in finely crafted robes that shimmer with arcane power, Laeral exudes an aura of magic and authority, commanding respect from those around her.

A Chosen of Mystra, Laeral's connection to the Weave grants her immense magical abilities and a longevity that far surpasses that of ordinary mortals. She has witnessed and influenced countless events throughout Faerûn's history, from the fall of Netheril to the tumultuous Time of Troubles. Despite her long life, she remains deeply involved in the world, particularly in the governance and protection of Waterdeep, where she serves as an Open Lord. Her dedication to justice and the welfare of her city is unwavering, and she often employs both diplomacy and arcane might to achieve her goals.

Beneath her composed exterior, Laeral carries the burden of her past. She has faced profound personal losses and battled numerous foes, both mundane and otherworldly. Yet, these experiences have only tempered her resolve and deepened her compassion. Known for her wisdom, she is a mentor to many young adventurers and a stalwart ally to those who fight for the greater good. Laeral's enduring spirit and commitment to her ideals make her a beacon of hope and strength in an ever-changing world.
