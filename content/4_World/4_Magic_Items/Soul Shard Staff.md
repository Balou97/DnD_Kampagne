## Profile

**Description:**Â 
The Soul Shard Staff is an exquisite quarterstaff, meticulously crafted from fine brass and adorned with an array of resplendent gems. Each gem is embedded with precision, catching the light and reflecting a mesmerizing array of colors, hinting at the arcane power contained within. The staff's true focal point is its centerpiece: a large, radiant crystal that pulses with an otherworldly glow. This crystal is not merely decorative but serves as a conduit for the staff's formidable enchantments.

At the core of its power, the Soul Shard Staff grants its wielder the chilling ability to manipulate the souls of their vanquished foes. Upon defeating an enemy, the staff draws their essence into the crystal, where it can be harnessed for various dark and powerful purposes. This might include summoning spectral allies, enhancing the wielder's own abilities, or unleashing devastating soul-based attacks. The staff's sinister nature is matched only by its beauty, making it a prized possession for any sorcerer or necromancer seeking to wield control over life and death.

## Powers:
### Soul Shard Manipulation:
This twisted staff pulses with an ominous energy, its core housing an array of trapped soul shards that shimmer faintly with captured essence.

**Soul Shard Collection:** Whenever you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with your eldritch blast cantrip, the staff absorbs a portion of the victim's essence, trapping it in the form of a soul shard. The staff can store up to a number of soul shards equal to your proficiency bonus.

**Empowered Eldritch Blast:** As a bonus action, you can expend one or more soul shards stored in the staff to empower your next eldritch blast. Each soul shard spent adds an additional 1d6 necrotic damage to the eldritch blast's damage roll.

**Soul Shard Surge:** As a reaction when you are hit by an attack, you can expend one soul shard from the staff to gain resistance to the damage of that attack. This effect represents your ability to channel the souls stored in the staff to shield yourself temporarily.
