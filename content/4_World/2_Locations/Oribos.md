## Profile

**Description:**Â 
Welcome to Oribos, once a beacon of scientific prowess and technological marvels, now a shadow of its former glory. Nestled in the heart of Lemuria, Oribos was a city where intellect and innovation thrived, a hub for the kingdom's brightest minds and most ambitious projects. Towering laboratories and gleaming research facilities once defined its skyline, showcasing the city's dedication to progress and discovery.

Oribos was renowned for its cutting-edge advancements in various fields, from alchemy and engineering to arcane research and artificery. The city's streets were lined with workshops, academies, and institutes where scholars and inventors collaborated to push the boundaries of knowledge. It was here that the legendary artificers Dr. Dr. Thereon Aelnor and Dr. Dr. Jarvis brought forth their revolutionary creations, including the infamous Warforged machines designed to defend Lemuria.

However, the ambition that drove Oribos to greatness also led to its downfall. The project to create a formidable army of Warforged machines took a dark turn when Springwater demanded modifications that compromised the ethical integrity of the designs. The ensuing conflict between Thereon and Jarvis culminated in a catastrophic event that saw the destruction of most Warforged prototypes and the ruin of Oribos.

In the aftermath, the once-vibrant city fell into desolation. The surviving scientists, scattered and demoralized, fled or went into hiding. Oribos, now a haunting ruin, came under the control of a ruthless goblin cartel. The notorious Jastor Gallywix seized the opportunity to capitalize on the remnants of the city's technological treasures. Though Gallywix is currently absent, the city's administration has temporarily fallen to Thereon Aelnor, who has returned under the pseudonym Uldon Bryn to manage the day-to-day affairs.

Today, Oribos stands as a stark contrast to its illustrious past. The grand laboratories and research facilities are in disrepair, their once-bright halls now echoing with the whispers of forgotten experiments. The city is a patchwork of decaying grandeur and goblin enterprise, where opportunistic merchants and scavengers sift through the remnants of its technological legacy.

Yet, despite its fall from grace, Oribos remains a place of intrigue and potential. Hidden within its ruins are secrets and technologies that could still change the course of history. For those brave enough to navigate its treacherous streets, Oribos offers both danger and the promise of untold discoveries.

To walk through Oribos is to tread on the edge of the past and future, where the echoes of innovation still linger amidst the rubble. It is a testament to the perils of unchecked ambition and a reminder that even in decay, the spirit of ingenuity can endure.
