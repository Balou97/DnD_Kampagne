**Backstory:**
Franziskus grew up in Waterdeep, known for his sense of justice and skill in combat. Joining the City Watch, he became respected for his dedication and loyalty, often unwinding with comrades over ale. During a brutal attack on the city by Strahd´s Army, his fellow soldiers fought valiantly but suffered heavy losses, including his commander, Commander  Cormac Stonefist. In a moment of despair and rage, Franziskus took up his halberd, a symbol of leadership, and broke his oath as a Paladin to seek vengeance. The halberd, stained with the blood of friends and foes alike, now serves as a reminder of his failure and the cost of war. 

Now an Oath-breaker, Franziskus wanders around, haunted by memories of that tragic night. The taste of ale, once a comfort among friends, now serves as a bitter reminder of his betrayal. He seeks redemption, knowing he can never fully amend his past transgressions but hoping to find a path back to honor and forgiveness. Carrying the burden of his broken oath and the weight of Bloodbane, he roams the city streets, driven by a solitary quest for redemption amidst the shadows of his shattered ideals.
