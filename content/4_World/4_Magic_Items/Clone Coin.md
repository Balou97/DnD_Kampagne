## Profile

**Description:**Â 
This small, intricately engraved gold coin bears the image of a shifting illusion on one side.

## Powers:
**Usage**: You can use a Bonus Action to activate the Coin of Mirage. When activated, you can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Simultaneously, you create a perfect visual illusion of yourself in the space you left behind. This illusion lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it as a Bonus Action, or if you become incapacitated.

**Benefits**: While the illusion created by the Coin of Mirage persists, you gain the following benefits:

- **Spellcasting**: You can cast spells as though you were occupying the illusion's space. This allows you to remain hidden while effectively using spells.
    
- **Distract**: When you and your illusion are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the illusion, you have Advantage on attack rolls against that creature. The presence of multiple versions of you confuses and unsettles your enemies, making it difficult for them to predict your movements.
    
- **Move**: As a Bonus Action, you can mentally move the illusion up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of yourself. After moving the illusion, you can teleport, swapping places with the illusion. This teleportation trick allows for strategic repositioning or escaping dangerous situations.
    
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus times per Long Rest.
