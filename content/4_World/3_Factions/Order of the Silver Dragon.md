## Profile

**Description:**Â 
The Order of the Silver Dragon is a noble and storied organization. Founded by the honorable dragon Argynvost, the order was established to protect the innocent and uphold the values of justice, honor, and chivalry. Based in the majestic Argynvostholt, a grand manor that once shone as a beacon of hope, the Order of the Silver Dragon stood as a bastion of light against the encroaching darkness of Barovia.

The knights of the Order of the Silver Dragon are renowned for their unwavering commitment to their cause. Clad in shining armor and bearing the emblem of the silver dragon, they were once a formidable force dedicated to combating evil in all its forms. Their leader, Argynvost, was a wise and powerful silver dragon who took the guise of a human nobleman to guide his followers. Under his leadership, the order fought valiantly against the forces of darkness, striving to protect the people of Barovia from the malevolent influence of Strahd von Zarovich.

Tragically, the Order of the Silver Dragon met its downfall during the war against Strahd. Argynvost was slain, and his knights were overwhelmed by Strahd's relentless forces. Argynvostholt fell into ruin, and the spirits of the fallen knights became restless, unable to find peace. Today, the order's legacy endures as a symbol of hope and resistance. Adventurers who stumble upon Argynvostholt may find themselves caught in the lingering struggle between the forces of light and darkness, with the spirits of the Order of the Silver Dragon urging them to continue the fight against the tyranny of Strahd and to restore the light that once shone so brightly in Barovia.
