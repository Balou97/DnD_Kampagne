## Profile

**Description:** 
Lazy-Eye Larry is a middle-aged, grizzled sea captain who has spent most of his life ferrying goods between [[Waterdeep]] and [[Springwater]] aboard his beloved ship, The Leaky Lobster. Weathered by countless voyages, his rugged appearance reflects a life lived at sea, though his demeanor is laid-back and easygoing—befitting his nickname. While his career may seem uneventful, he is content with the routine of transporting cargo, seeing himself as a simple man doing an honest day's work.

The highlight of Larry’s otherwise mundane life came when he crossed paths with [[Jastor Gallywix]], a notorious goblin lord. That brief encounter turned into an unforgettable experience, one that Larry still recounts with excitement.
