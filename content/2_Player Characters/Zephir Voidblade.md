**Backstory:**
Zephir Voidblade was born into a society of warriors, where strength and cunning dictated one's worth. Growing up in the Astral Plane, Zephir was trained from a young age in the art of combat and the use of psionics—a gift that flowed through his bloodline. His family was part of a respected lineage that had participated in countless raids against Mind Flayers, seeking to reclaim their ancestral homeland and protect their kind from the tyranny of other races.

During a pivotal raid, Zephir and his companions stumbled upon a hidden cache of ancient psionic relics. Among them was a legendary artifact that awakened deep psionic powers in him, allowing him to manipulate the battlefield with a mere thought. Fueled by his newfound abilities, he rose quickly through the ranks, earning the title of “Voidblade” for his skill in both physical and mental combat.

However, his aspirations changed when he witnessed the brutality of a raid gone wrong, leading to the unnecessary death of innocents. This event plagued his mind, causing him to question the endless cycle of violence enforced by his people. In rebellion against his heritage, Zephir broke away from the Githyanki cause, seeking redemption and purpose beyond warfare.

Now, he travels the multiverse as a wandering warrior, using his powers to help those in need and gather knowledge about other races, hoping one day to unite different factions against a common enemy—those who threaten the freedom of all. With every step, he seeks not only to carve his own path but also to reshape the destiny of the Githyanki.
