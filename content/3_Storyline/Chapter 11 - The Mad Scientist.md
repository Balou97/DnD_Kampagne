### Journey to Springwater
To attend the audience with [[King Arcturus XIII]], the team once again travels to [[Springwater]]. At the harbor of [[Waterdeep]], they encounter [[Lazy-Eye Larry]] and his ship, the _Leaking Lobster_. After brief negotiations, the group manages to secure a cheap passage to Springwater. Upon arrival, they notice some subtle changes in the city. In the outer districts, where the lower class lives, City Watchers patrol, equipped with mechanical backpacks. The group had already seen one of these backpacks before when they fought Tatyana.

With the help of a letter from [[Laeral Silverhand|Lady Laeral]], the group passes into the inner city without difficulty. [[Jastor Gallywix|Jastor]] visits a tailor to outfit his two slaves, Garona and Grog, in fine clothing. Meanwhile, the others make various purchases at [[The Arcane Eye]], a magic item shop run by [[Pumat Sol]]. [[FEND]] and [[Zephir Voidblade|Zephir]] both acquire a [[dwarven-plate]] and a [[ring-of-protection]].

After their shopping, they head towards the palace, where they come across a group of soldiers from [[Order of the Silver Dragon]] being beaten by two [[City-Watch.jpeg|City Watchers]]. The group destroys the City Watchers and heals the soldiers. The leader of this troop is [[Uthliz]], the son of Commander [[Oathliz]]. In their hideout, Uthliz explains to the group what has transpired in Springwater over the past few weeks.

By royal decree, all guilds in the city have been officially dissolved, and those who resist have been hunted, killed, or imprisoned. At the same time, the coat of arms of the Kingdom of Lemuria has been changed to the [[PupleDragon Emblem.png|emblem of the Purple Dragon]].

### Audience with the King
Armed with this knowledge, the group heads to the palace, where they meet the king for the first time. King Arcturus seems absent-minded, murmuring the same thing repeatedly under his breath. In the shadows behind him stands another figure, [[Dr. Dr. Jarvis]], the king’s advisor, who constantly whispers into the king’s ear during the conversation. [[Franziskus]] attempts to dispel the influence over the king with his divine magic. Although he manages to enter the king's mind, he ultimately fails.

Jarvis tells the group about the mission [[Emberon Dragonheart]] has undertaken and invites them to follow him to his lab.

Upon arriving in the lab, they meet Emberon, who now looks different than before. Half of his body has taken on draconic features, and tubes are attached to his body, connected to [[Jarvis_Lab.jpeg|two tanks]] filled with purple and red liquid. The conversation with Emberon escalates, leading to a fight.

The battle ends with the group reviving Jarvis and knocking Emberon unconscious. On Jarvis body they find a mysterious book. It contains a [[Manifest]] called "Die Schuppen des Heils", written by Zephyr Solvyrth himself and it describes his greater vision for the world. On the last page of the manifest there is a family tree showing multiple different images of purple ancient dragons and their names, like Solvarak / Solkarith / Solmyrrax / Solrathan / Solvaeryn / etc.
