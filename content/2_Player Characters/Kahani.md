**Backstory:**
Kahani hatched amidst the ruins of an advanced tribe in a tropical environment. The tribe's downfall came swiftly when an orc raiding party invaded just before his birth. Despite being born an albino lizardfolk, a heretical resemblance to Semuanya's Messenger, Kahani was spared from immediate death by being buried deep within the hatching grounds during the chaos of battle. Emerging into a devastated world, he found only a handful of survivors struggling to fend off starvation. Understanding their dire situation, the tribe's shaman, gravely injured from the invasion, imparted their stories and wisdom to Kahani and the few other newborns, hoping one might grow strong enough to revive and safeguard their tribe.

In the unforgiving jungle environment teeming with threats, Kahani learned to survive through cunning and resourcefulness. Overcoming years of hardship, he honed his skills to the point where he could defeat even the most formidable beasts with the daggers he had taken from an ill-fated adventurer. Returning to his tribe after achieving strength, Kahani discovered another lizardfolk had already emerged as a potential leader. Fearing rejection or worse, given his aberrant scales, Kahani chose to depart once more, embarking on a path of mercenary work and assassination to sustain his existence and forge his own destiny in the world.
