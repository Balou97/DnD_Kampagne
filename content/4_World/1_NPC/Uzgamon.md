## Profile

**Description:**Â 
Uzgamon is an Amnizu who are typically known to be guarding the River Styx that's flowing down all nine layers of the hell. Amnizus are known to be unspeakably loyal to their associated arch devil, but it seems Uzgamon is the exception of this rule because he has his own plans in his mind.
He is currently located in the Astral plane, seemingly to hide himself and ordered the Deam via a devilish contract to help him retrieve a contained Soul from the 2nd layer of hell.
