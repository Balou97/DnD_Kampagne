## Profile

**Description:** 
This 2-foot-diameter black sphere is a tear in the fabric of the multiverse, surrounded by a shimmering field that stabilizes its existence.
## Powers:
**Annihilation Field:** The sphere obliterates all matter it comes into contact with and anything that passes through it. Non-artifact objects that touch or are touched by the sphere are immediately and irrevocably destroyed, leaving no trace. Artifacts are the only exception; those not susceptible to its effects pass through unharmed.

**Control and Movement:** The sphere remains stationary until a creature attuned to it takes control. To assert control, the attuned creature must be within 60 feet of the uncontrolled sphere and use an action to make a DC 35 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a success, the sphere can be commanded to levitate in one direction of the creature's choice, moving up to a number of feet equal to 5 times their Intelligence modifier. On a failure, the sphere moves 20 feet directly towards the attuned creature.

**Dangerous Presence:** When the Sphere of Annihilation moves into a space occupied by a creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be touched by it.

- **Immediate Contact:** Upon first being touched by the sphere, the creature takes 1D4 x 10 force damage. Additionally, they begin to be drawn towards the sphere and are [[conditions|incapacitated]] until they no longer touch the sphere.
    
- **Continued Threat:** On each subsequent turn that the creature remains in contact with the sphere, they must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, they take an additional 1D4 x 10 force damage and are pulled further into the sphere’s gravitational pull. On a successful Constitution saving throw, the creature can escape the sphere’s immediate grasp, but not without dire consequences. Parts of their body may be irreparably damaged or torn away by the sphere’s annihilating force.
	- Everytime a creature takes damage from the Sphere Roll **1D4**
		- 1: The Left Arm gets ripped off (Disadvantage)
		- 2: The Left Leg gets ripped off (Speed Halved)
		- 3: The Right Arms gets ripped off (Disadvantage)
		- 4: The Right Leg gets Ripped off (Speed Halved)
	- After losing a limb roll a Constitution Saving Throw **DC 20** or fall unconscious from the shock.
**Magic Nullification:** The gravity of the Sphere of Annihilation is so immense that it disrupts and nullifies the Weave of magic. Spells and magical effects cannot function within a **5-foot radius** of the sphere.
	- Exceptions to this are planar portals and the magic caused by a Wish or Divine Intervention
