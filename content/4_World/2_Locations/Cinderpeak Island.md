## Profile

**Description:**Â 
Cinderpeak Island is a tropical Island south of Waterdeep but doesn't belong to the Kingdom Lemuria. Previously the Island was only inhabited by Lizardfolks but after they got raided by the Emberfist Clan they got enslaved and have to share the Island with them. [[Rukar Emberfist]] and Rakur Emberfist are the chiefs of the Clan but their Connection to Springwater got enforced by [[Cad Bane]], another Lizardfolk who was about to free the Tribe, but sold them instead.
