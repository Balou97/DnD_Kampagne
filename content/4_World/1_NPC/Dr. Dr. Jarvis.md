## Profile

**Description:** 
Dr. Dr. Jarvis first got mentioned at the Midwinter Festival when it was announced that the Strength-Testing Machines were sponsored by him.

Jarvis, once a respected scientist from Oribos, now walks a far darker path by choice, working in Springwater, the capital city of Lemuria. He and his former colleague, Dr. Thereon Aelnor, once led the field of technological innovation with their creation of the Warforged—sentient machines designed for protection. However, their partnership shattered when Jarvis adopted new ambitions, driven by a more sinister origin. Unlike Thereon, who saw the Warforged as protectors, Jarvis began to view them as weapons of conquest, capable of expanding Lemuria's borders and controlling its people with unyielding force.

Jarvis wasn’t forced into this descent—he embraced it. These new ambitions, sparked by a darker influence, led him to willingly abandon Oribos and the ethics he once shared with Thereon. Seduced by the potential to reshape Lemuria's power through militarized Warforged, Jarvis sought to turn his creations into an army for domination. His shift in purpose wasn’t simply about expanding his scientific horizons but about the desire for control, power, and a vision of a stronger, more ruthless Lemuria. His departure from Oribos was not a flight from duty but a step toward realizing his new, darker goals.

Now fully entrenched in his role in Springwater, Jarvis is no longer the idealistic scientist he once was. His Warforged creations, once symbols of progress, have become instruments of fear and oppression. Though he has alienated many of his former peers, Jarvis is consumed by the belief that his path—however ruthless—will lead Lemuria to unparalleled greatness. His pursuit of power, fueled by these sinister new ambitions, has transformed him into a figure both feared and respected, a man whose brilliance now serves a far darker purpose.
