**Backstory:**
Born into the noble, yet largely inconsequential House Dragonheart of Waterdeep, Percival Dragonheart’s lineage traces back to his grandfather, a bard whose charm and humor earned him an unlikely elevation to nobility by the Lord of Waterdeep. This forebear, ever the storyteller, spun wild tales of romantic liaisons with dragons—a claim met with skepticism and laughter. Yet, in a curious twist of fate, Percival was born a Draconic Sorcerer, lending an air of mystery to his grandfather’s outlandish stories.

The Dragonheart name, chosen with theatrical flair by Percival's bardic grandfather, has always struck Percival as embarrassingly ostentatious. Despite this, his family’s status among Waterdeep's nobility remained at the lowest rung. Their fortunes took a drastic turn for the worse when an attack on Waterdeep left their ancestral home in ruins, plunging House Dragonheart into financial ruin and obscurity.

Percival's immediate family is his anchor. His father, Aurelion Dragonheart, the current head of the house, and his mother, Isolde, are his pillars of support. He shares a close bond with his older brother, Ignatius, and his younger sister, Saphira. In stark contrast, his uncles, aunts, and numerous cousins epitomize snobbish nobility, detached from the harsh realities facing their house.

Among his extended family, his cousin Emberon stands out as a rival. Also a Draconic Sorcerer, Emberon skillfully plays the noble card at every turn, reaping far more success and recognition than Percival. Their rivalry is fueled by Emberon’s condescending superiority and Percival's determination to restore his house’s fortunes. Emberon’s success only sharpens Percival’s resolve to prove his worth and rebuild his family’s legacy, even as he grapples with the embarrassing legacy of the Dragonheart name.

Now, Percival is driven by the desire to lift his family from their downfall. He is less concerned with restoring the tarnished reputation of House Dragonheart, given his distaste for its grandiose name, and more focused on ensuring its financial and social recovery. With his draconic powers and unyielding determination, Percival sets out to carve a new path for himself and his family, amidst the ruins of their past glory.
