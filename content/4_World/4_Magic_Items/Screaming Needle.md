# `=this.file.name`
## Profile

**Description:**Â 
This very thin dagger, almost like a needle, appears deceptively delicate. Its blade is unnaturally sharp and slick with black blood that perpetually drips down its length. When wielded, faint, tormented whispers can be heard emanating from the blade, sending chills down the spine of anyone nearby.

## Powers:
#### Mind Shatter:
When you successfully hit a target with this weapon, you can choose to use this feature. When you do so, the DC for the enemy to pass the concentration saving throw is doubled. 

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest.
