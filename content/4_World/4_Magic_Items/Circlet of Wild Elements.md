## Profile

**Description:**Â 
Fashioned from polished gold and adorned with elaborate filigree that twists and curls around its band, the Circlet of Wild Elements exudes an air of enchantment and elegance. At its forefront, a large diamond, clear as the sky at dawn, captures and refracts light in a dazzling display. The gem's facets seem to shimmer with an ever-changing spectrum of colors, hinting at the volatile power it holds within.

Upon closer inspection, intricate arcane sigils are subtly etched into the filigree, their faint glow barely perceptible to the eye. These runes pulse gently with an inner energy, resonating with the circlet's ability to tap into elemental forces. When worn, the circlet rests comfortably on the brow, its weight insignificant despite its ornate craftsmanship.

## Powers:
#### Elemental Flux
This ornate circlet pulses with unpredictable elemental energy. When you make a Soulknife attack while attuned to this circlet, roll a d10 to determine the element your attack takes:

- **1-9:** Your attack gains the corresponding elemental property and a +1 bonus to both attack rolls and damage rolls.
    
    - 1: Fire
    - 2: Cold
    - 3: Lightning
    - 4: Acid
    - 5: Thunder
    - 6: Poison
    - 7: Radiant
    - 8: Necrotic
    - 9: Force
- **10:** Your attack deals an additional 1d6 psychic damage and also deals psychic damage as usual. Additionally, you take 1d4 psychic damage from the sudden psionic spike.
