## Profile

**Description:** 
King Arcturus XIII, once a beloved and benevolent ruler of the Kingdom of Lemuria, has seen his reign take a dark and tragic turn. For years, he was known for his fairness, wisdom, and unwavering kindness, guiding the people of Lemuria with a gentle yet firm hand from his palace in [[Springwater]]. His leadership brought prosperity to the kingdom, and he was adored by his subjects. But all of that changed the day his beloved daughter, Tatyana, was mysteriously murdered. The grief was too much for the once-strong king to bear, and it shattered him completely. [[Dr. Dr. Jarvis]], his closest advisor and right hand, accused Lord [[Strahd von Zarovich]] of the heinous crime, igniting a thirst for revenge within the broken king.

Consumed by sorrow and rage, King Arcturus retreated into the depths of his palace, isolating himself from the world and falling deeper under the influence of Jarvis. The once-kind ruler began to lose his way, allowing Jarvis to take control over the kingdom's affairs. Under Jarvis's guidance, Arcturus authorized the creation of a massive army, aimed at waging war against Lord Strahd. What the public does not realize is that their once-noble king is no longer the man they knew. Jarvis, whispering dark ambitions into the king’s ear, seems to have a near-mind control over Arcturus, bending his will to pursue war and vengeance rather than peace.

Though outwardly King Arcturus still appears to lead, many close to the crown suspect that something is terribly wrong. His decisions grow colder, more ruthless, and his once-warm demeanor has turned icy. The kingdom, unaware of the full extent of Jarvis's influence, can only watch in confusion and fear as the kindhearted king they loved is slowly lost to the snake-tongued manipulation of his advisor.
