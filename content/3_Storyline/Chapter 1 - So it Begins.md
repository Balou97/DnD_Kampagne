### The Midwinter Festival

The Midwinter Festival in [[Waterdeep]] brought together four adventurers who had not yet crossed paths. [[Franziskus]], a human Paladin and soldier of Waterdeep; [[Delondrus Doondrum]], a Loxodon Druid newly arrived in the city; [[Kahani]], a Lizardfolk Rogue with connections to underground societies like the Zhentarim; and [[FEND]], a Warforged Artificer, a gentle giant in search of his mentor.

### Festivities and Competitions

They participated in various intriguing competitions such as guessing the number of beans in a jar, drinking contests, and testing their strength with advanced punching machines sponsored by [[Dr. Dr. Jarvis]] from the capital, [[Springwater]]. The group engaged in these festivities and emerged victorious, winning formidable prizes.

### The Werewolf Attack

Suddenly, the entire marketplace was bathed in a blinding light. A massive fireball hurtled towards the citizens at great speed. Miraculously, thanks to Delondrus' heroic intervention, who conjured a spontaneous wall of plants, the fireball was halted, sparing any harm to the people. However, a new threat emerged swiftly: a horde of werewolves descended upon the city. The adventurers joined forces and managed to defeat the werewolves, but not before one of them kidnapped a child.

### Seeking Answers

Lady [[Laeral Silverhand]], the Lady of Waterdeep, informed them that children had been frequently abducted in recent months, though she was unaware of the reason. She mentioned [[Artor Morlin]], a somewhat benevolent vampire residing in Waterdeep's sewers, who might possess more information. After solving a few moderate riddles, they learned from Artor Morlin about a ritual enabling vampires to resist fire damage, requiring the sacrifice of twelve children at a specific time.

### The Arcane Eye

At the magic store "[[The Arcane Eye]]," they met [[Pumat Sol]], a Tortle who owned branches in every major city and stocked up on their rations and potions

### Encounter with Rahadin

The group learned of an abandoned [[BM_Church Ruin.jpeg|ruin of a church]] where the abducted children were believed to be held. After luring away the ogres guarding the area, they discovered a secret [[BM_Church_Dungeon.jpeg|underground cave]] beneath the ruins. There, they encountered [[Rahadin]], a powerful vampire and former right-hand of Lord Strahd von Zarovich himself. With ruthless determination, they defeated Rahadin and rescued the children. Additionally, Rahadin's servant, [[Pidlwick II]], chose to accompany them. They returned a defeated werewolf named Halfdan to Waterdeep, where he was healed by the local priest. Halfdan and his wife Frieda pledged their allegiance to the group in gratitude.

### The Reward

As a reward for their heroic deeds, Lady Laeral granted them a plot of land with a tavern on it. The group named themselves "[[The Deam]]" henceforth, and their tavern became known as "[[The Davern]]."
