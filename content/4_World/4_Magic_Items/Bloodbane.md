## Profile

**Description:** 
Bloodbane is a weapon of legendary infamy, forged in the fires of the arcane and tempered with the blood of fallen warriors. This halberd's dark blade is etched with ancient runes that glow faintly with an eerie light, signifying its hunger for the lifeblood of its victims. Each time Bloodbane delivers a fatal blow, it drains the very essence of its target, channeling the stolen vitality into its wielder. This gruesome process heals the wielder for 1D8 hit points, a grim testament to the weapon's thirst for life and its unholy power. The polearm’s shaft is adorned with intricate carvings of scenes depicting past battles and conquests, growing more detailed and elaborate with each soul it claims.

The weapon’s malevolent nature is further enhanced by its ability to evolve, gaining strength and abilities from the blood of particularly powerful foes. When Bloodbane tasted the blood of a mighty dragon, it underwent a profound transformation. The blade darkened to a deeper, more menacing hue, and the runes flared with an intense, fiery glow. This draconic infusion granted Bloodbane a fearsome new power: once per turn, the wielder can unleash a devastating Dragon’s Breath attack. By using one of their attack actions, they can cast a fiery cone of destruction, forcing all creatures within a 20-foot radius to make a Dexterity saving throw. Those who fail suffer 6D6 fire damage, while even those who succeed take half damage. This formidable ability can be used a number of times equal to the wielder's proficiency bonus per short rest, making Bloodbane not only a weapon of close combat dominance but also a harbinger of fiery ruin from afar.

Bloodbane’s ever-growing thirst for powerful blood makes it a coveted and feared weapon among warriors and sorcerers alike. Its ability to adapt and grow stronger with each formidable foe it fells ensures that it is always at the pinnacle of lethality. The weapon’s presence is marked by an aura of dread, and its history is written in the blood of the vanquished, promising unimaginable power to those who can master its insatiable hunger and wield its fearsome abilities without succumbing to the darkness it embodies.

## Powers:
### Life Drinker:
Every time Bloodbane is used to deal a fatal blow to a creature, the weapon drains the blood of its victim and grants the wielder healing of 1d8 hit points.

### Blood Drain - Dragon´s Breath:
After tasting the blood of a dragon, Bloodbane's appearance transformed. Once per turn, you can use one of your Attack actions to cast Dragon’s Breath. All creatures within a 20-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest.
