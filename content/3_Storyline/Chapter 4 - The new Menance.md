### The Security Council
On their way back to [[Waterdeep]], the group receives a letter delivered by an owl from Lady [[Laeral Silverhand]], inviting them to the [[BM_Waterdeep Council.jpeg|Security Council]] meeting. At the council, the Open Lords of Waterdeep are present, along with familiar faces such as Lady Laeral, [[Pumat Sol]], the magic shop owner with political ties, and [[Artor Morlin]], the vampire from the sewers who assists with his knowledge about vampires.

During the assembly, the group learns that the powerful and evil Vampirelord [[Strahd von Zarovich]] has returned and is residing in his fortress, Ravenloft. To defeat him, they must seal him away and therefore need an artifact powerful enough to contain Strahd's immense power. Pumat Sol gives the party a [[TM_Ravenqueen-Ruin.jpeg|map]] that leads them to the temple of the Ravenqueen, which might hides an artefact inside.

Suddenly, Lady Laeral is attacked by an until now invisible Kenku named [[Scourge]]. The group engages the assassin, and when he tries to flee and hides in the cellar, where they corner and defeat him. At the moment of his defeat, [[Kahani]] absorbs the Kenku and takes on his visual appearance, which highly confuses everybody around. It turns out that Kahani belongs to a race called slime.

### Recruitment at the Docks
Before setting off, the group heads towards the docks to hire additional workers. Along the way, [[Franziskus]] is being robbed. They follow the trail and confront a tough gang. Franziskus defeats their leader [[Knut]] in a brawl, convincing them to work for the group.

### Ambush on the Road to Steelheim
During their journey to [[Steelheim]], the group falls into a trap, set by two bounty hunters intent on stealing the [[Crystal Ball]] Kahani possesses. After a fierce battle, they defeat the wizard named [[Alastor Moody]], but his partner [[Declan]] manages to escape with the crystal ball. FEND acquires [[The Eye of Uzgamon]], a magical Eye patch from Alastor, that houses a powerful demonic entity. After this incident Kahani and Delondrus decided to track down the bounty hunter and get the Crystal Ball back. Shortly after the rest of the group met two new allies - [[Jastor Gallywix]] and [[Jhalrak van Durn]] who both decided to join the Deam.

### The Army of the Dead
On the way to the temple, the group notices a massive army consisting of undead, werewolves, trolls, and ogres marching from north to south. Despite this ominous sight, they press on towards the temple. Finding the entrance beneath the icy surface of the black lake.

### Trial of the Ravenqueen
After entering the temple through the underwater entrance, they meet an old dwarf named [[Malgus Schwarzfeder]], who is sitting on a stone with a mug in his hand. He is the guardian of this temple and a faithful disciple of the Raven Queen. After completing the [[BM_Sunken Temple.jpeg|Trial of the Raven Queen]], they have a challenging encounter with an aboleth. After slaying the monster, they receive [[The Ring of the Ravenqueen]]. Additionally, Franziskus, a big drinker and lover of fine ale, gets the [[Mug of Everflowing Ale]] from Malgus. However, to make it not too simple, Malgus does not tell him the magical code words. And thus begins Franziskus's journey to find the code word.
