### The Goblin Heist
The group is planning a heist on the goblins who supply weapons to [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]. They prepare a diversion in the field camp, and as chaos spreads, they strike a bit further away, in the middle of the night. They defeat the leader of the goblin squad and "enslave" the two weaker goblins, Sproggie and Krunk. At the same moment they blow up the [[Steam_Armor.png]], they notice someone watching them. Twenty feet from the scene stands a carriage pulled by an old donkey, with a mage staring at them in shock. An awkward silence ensues, and out of sheer fear, the mage, named [[Hans Dietrich]], joins the group.

### Journey to Oribos
Together, they march back to Lord Strahd, recover, and set off on a three-week journey to [[Oribos]]. On the way, they have a bloody encounter with a [[Remorhaz.png]] and subsequently find a [[Snail_Egg.jpg|huge snail egg]]. Upon arriving in Oribos, they infiltrate the Undercity and the Goblin Cartel by exploiting the signet rings they have stolen.

After gaining access to the Undercity of the Bilgewater Cartel, the group marches deeper into the old mine, where they find [[FEND|FEND's]] mentor, [[Thereon Aelnor]], along with 25 other enslaved scientists and citizens of Oribos. After several failed attempts to convince the guards to let them see Thereon, they start a [[Underground Mine Rave.jpg|rave]]. Captivated by the music, the goblins tap a keg of ale and begin partying wildly until they pass out from the alcohol. This allows the group to free Thereon and the other slaves and smuggle them out of the Undercity.

Some time later, in the city's astronomy tower, Thereon tells them about the Heart of Oribos and a purple crystal similar to the one in Ravenloft. This crystal is located in the [[BM_Revilgaz Chamber.jpeg|bedroom]] of the [[Baron Revilgaz|Big Boss Revilgaz]], who becomes their next target. He also tells them about the Women from Waterdeep who was making the weapon deals with Revilgaz. He remembers that she was wearing a dark cloak - pinned with a unique [[PupleDragon Emblem.png|Emblem]] showing the head of a purple Dragon.

### The Battle against Baron Revilgaz
The group returns to the Undercity to confront and eliminate Baron Revilgaz. Without much hesitation, they walk past the drunken guards and make their way to the grand hall. There, the final encounter begins with two guards in their [[Steam_Armor.png|Steam Armor]]. After defeating these guards, an alarm is triggered, which starts to awaken the drunken guards of the entire Undercity, who will soon be arriving.

Following a long and brutal [[BM_Cartel Hall.jpeg|battle]] with Revilgaz, his underboss, and two members of the Zhentarim - [[Kahani]] and [[Declan]], the group ultimately emerges victorious. As a reward for freeing the Djinn, they are granted a wish, which they use to revive little Iris and her mother, whos ghost they met back in [[Krezk]]. Also, Jastor takes the [[Revilgaz Ring.jpg|Ring]] from Revilgaz and is from now on the Leader of the remaining Goblins.

Afterward, they examine the crystal, where FEND has another vision. In this [[Vision_2.jpg|vision]], the combined forces of Springwater and Waterdeep march into battle against Strahd.
