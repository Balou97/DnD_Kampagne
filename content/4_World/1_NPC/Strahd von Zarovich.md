## Profile

**Description:** 
Strahd was once a high-ranking knight and warrior of the kingdom of Lemuria and a subordinate of the then King of Springwater, which was many centuries ago. Lemuria and Barovia were at war, and Strahd was sent with his army to Barovia to conquer the land. After succeeding, he was declared the ruler of Barovia. Both kingdoms enjoyed prosperity, abundant resources, and riches.

One day, a cloaked figure entered the castle with the command to be admitted. Due to a seal on the cloak, Strahd recognized that the cloaked person was from Springwater. When entry was denied, a battle ensued. With a powerful spell, the cloaked figure put everyone into a deep sleep. After more than a month, they awoke to find a magical object placed in the castle’s cellar: a magical crystal on a stone altar. Every attempt to touch the crystal failed. Furthermore, it became evident that Strahd was no longer a normal elf but had become a vampire—the first of his kind. Additionally, his great love, Tatyana, had been kidnapped.

With his new powers and unquenchable rage, Strahd assembled an army of undead, werewolves, trolls, and other creatures who had been shunned and ostracized by the "normal" world. A centuries-long war broke out between Barovia and the neighboring kingdoms until one day, Strahd was sealed in a magical vessel, then a vase, by the powerful mage Alatar. This was only possible because Rahadin, Strahd's right hand, had betrayed him.

Exactly 100 years after his sealing, Strahd escaped from his prison and began anew, building a massive army to finally exact his revenge.
