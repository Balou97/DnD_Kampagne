## Profile

**Description:** 
Emberon Dragonheart, Percival’s cousin, epitomizes the very essence of nobility with a flair that far outshines his family’s modest status. Born into the same lineage as Percival, Emberon’s adept manipulation of his Draconic Sorcerer abilities and natural charisma has earned him substantial recognition and success. Unlike Percival, who bears the weight of their family's downfall, Emberon thrives within the noble circles of Waterdeep, leveraging his lineage and talents to ascend the social hierarchy. He is renowned for his cunning and strategic mind, often seen as a paragon of what House Dragonheart could be, had fortune favored them all equally.

Emberon’s relationship with Percival is marked by a sharp rivalry, fueled by Emberon’s condescending attitude and incessant need to assert his superiority. His successes serve as a constant reminder to Percival of the disparity within their shared lineage. Emberon’s disdain for the lower rungs of nobility and his cousins’ struggles is palpable, as he relishes in the recognition and prestige he garners. Yet, beneath his polished exterior lies a calculated ambition, driving him to maintain his standing and outshine all others, particularly Percival, whose quiet determination he views as a persistent threat to his own ascendency.
