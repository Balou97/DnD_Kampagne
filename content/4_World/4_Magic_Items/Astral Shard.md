## Profile

**Description:**Â 
The Astral Shard is a mesmerizing piece of crystallized essence from the Astral Plane itself, a miniature cosmos encapsulated within a swirling, silver-infused gem. Its core seems to pulse with faint echoes of distant stars and nebulae, captured within a translucent matrix that glimmers with an ethereal sheen. Held to the light, wisps of silvery mist dance within, hinting at the boundless expanse from which it originates.

Attuning to the Astral Shard requires a connection to the arcane mysteries that span realities. Once bonded, it can be affixed to any Tiny object, blending seamlessly with its form as if becoming a part of it. When used as a spellcasting focus, its surface faintly shimmers with the same silver mist, empowering the caster's magic with an otherworldly resonance.

## Powers:
### Astral Shard:
This crystal is a solidified shard of the Astral Plane, swirling with silver mist. As an action, you can attach the shard to a Tiny object (such as a weapon or a piece of jewelry) or detach it. It falls off if your attunement to it ends. You can use the shard as a spellcasting focus while you hold or wear it.

When you use a Metamagic option on a spell while you are holding or wearing the shard, immediately after casting the spell you can teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of you.
