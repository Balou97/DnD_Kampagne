### Arrival in Barovia
Upon entering the realm of Barovia, the group immediately sensed the differences in the environment and soon encountered their first foes. They were attacked by their own shadows, but managed to defeat them using Holy Water before continuing their journey.

Just before reaching [[Krezk]], they arrived at a tower where they met [[Rudolph van Richten]], also known as Rictavio the legendary Vampire Hunter. He had a fondness for adventurers and regaled them with extensive tales of his supposed heroic deeds. Additionally, he agreed to craft a Potion of Fire Resistance for [[Jastor Gallywix]]. After recuperating at Rictavio's, they set off for Krezk. [[Franziskus]] stayed behind, captivated by Rictavio's many stories.

Upon arriving in Krezk, they immediately felt the lack of hospitality from the few townsfolk who withdrew upon their approach. In the old library, they encountered the ghost Iris, afflicted by a curse. The group helped Iris break the curse, and in return, she provided them with information about the remaining blueprints of the castle. It turns out that a group of goblins had the blueprints stolen and were talking about heading back to [[Oribos]].

Shortly afterward, a carriage approached the group, and [[Pidlwick I]] revealed himself, delivering an invitation to the [[Castle Ravenloft]] presented within the severed head of [[Artor Morlin]].

### Castle Ravenloft
Upon arriving at Castle Ravenloft, the group was greeted with hospitality and gifts. Franziskus received the former [[Armor of Strahd]] himself. They were allowed to move freely around the castle and made several discoveries, such as Strahd's extensive and valuable library where they came across a very interesting book - "[[Chapter 0 - Introduction|The Eternal Scales: Ancient Legends and Tales]]" where they learned about the ancient gods Bahamut and Tiamat and their everlasting conflict, as well as a small magical item (Daern's Instant Fortress). In the topmost floor of the castle, the alchemy lab, they found a valuable Aether Root. 

During the main dinner, the group heard the full story from [[Strahd von Zarovich|StrahdÂ´s]] perspective and gained information about a [[Magical Crystal.jpg]] in the castle's catacombs. When [[FEND]] touched the crystal, he had a horrific [[Vision_1.png|Vision]] of a massive purple dragon laying waste to an entire kingdom. At the end, Rictavio unexpectedly appeared and attempted to attack Strahd. The group then faced a critical decision about which side to support.

The group neither decided to attack Strahd nor to support Rictavio. Instead, they persuaded him to pause and listen to Strahd's full story. Once Rictavio calmed down, Strahd proposed that they join forces to aid him in his quest for revenge against the kingdom of Lemuria. Faced with this unexpected request and uncertain about their decision, the group asked for more time to consider it and moved on to attend to other pressing matters.
