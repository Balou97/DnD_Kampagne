## Profile

**Description:** 
Baron Revilgaz is the formidable leader of the Bilgewater Cartel, operating from his headquarters deep within the Undercity of Oribos. From this shadowy stronghold, he orchestrates a vast network of illegal activities, most notably the weapon trade with the notorious Strahd von Zarovich. Revilgaz is known for his ruthlessness and cunning, traits that have allowed him to maintain control over the cartel and expand his influence. He acquires these weapons from a mysterious masked woman hailing from Waterdeep, ensuring a steady supply for his nefarious dealings.

Beyond his role as an arms dealer, Baron Revilgaz is also engaged in a grander, more insidious project. Using the enslaved citizens of Oribos, he is constructing an extensive underground tunnel that will connect Oribos directly to Waterdeep. This tunnel is intended to facilitate the smooth and secretive transportation of goods, people, and contraband, further solidifying his power and reach. The Baron’s ambitions and operations make him a significant threat, not only to the region but potentially to realms far beyond.
