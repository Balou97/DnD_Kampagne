**Backstory:**
The goblin people are divided into two so-called cartels, which generally remain neutral towards other races but engage in conflict with each other to secure their monopoly on trade and engineering. On one side is the Bilgewater Cartel, led by Baron Revilgaz, Lord of Booty Bay, and on the other side is the Steamwheedle Cartel, led by Marin Noggenfogger, Lord of Gadgetzan. Additionally, there are two independent trading posts: Ratchet, led by Gazlowe, and the Everlook, led by Razdunk. 

Jastor Gallywix was born on the island of Kezan and fled with a ship during the great volcanic eruption, where many goblins lost their lives. Now a wandering trader and CEO of the Venture Trading Company, he is on a path to become the richest man in the world.
