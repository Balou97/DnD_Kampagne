## Profile

**Description:** 
Forged from the fearsome fang of an ancient dragon, the Dragontooth Dagger exudes a menacing elegance. The blade, still razor-sharp, curves slightly with a natural serration that hints at its draconic origin. The handle, crafted from the tooth’s root, is expertly wrapped in supple, dark leather embossed with intricate, shimmering runes that seem to pulse with latent power. The lack of a crossguard lends it a sleek, streamlined appearance, perfect for quick, precise strikes.
## Powers:
### Blinkstrike
When you hit a creature with this dagger, you can choose to activate the Blinkstrike ability. The target must not be more than one size larger than you. As part of the attack action, you and the target swap places, teleporting to each other's previous locations. This ability can be used whether the dagger is thrown or used in melee.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses after finishing a short or long rest.
