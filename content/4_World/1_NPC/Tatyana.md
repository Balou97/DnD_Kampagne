## Profile

**Description:** 
Tatyana, once a radiant bride-to-be, vanished on her wedding day a century ago, snatched away by an unknown entity just moments before she could wed Strahd von Zarovich. Her disappearance left a void in many hearts, but none more so than Strahd’s. Believing her dead, Strahd’s grief turned to vengeance, fueling a relentless vendetta against Waterdeep, whom he blamed for his loss.

Now, a century later, Tatyana has inexplicably returned. Yet, she is but a shadow of the vibrant woman she once was. Her eyes, once sparkling with life and love, now seem distant and clouded. She moves with an eerie grace, her actions and words dictated by an unseen force. Powerful magic binds her, suppressing her own will and thoughts, making her a puppet in a cruel game orchestrated by her captor.

Her presence is both a miracle and a mystery, a living testament to the dark forces at play. Tatyana’s return has rekindled Strahd’s hope, but also deepened his rage as he seeks to uncover the truth behind her abduction and enslavement. Her condition serves as a haunting reminder of the power of magic and the fragility of free will, as those who once knew her struggle to comprehend the extent of her transformation and the dark magic that holds her captive.
