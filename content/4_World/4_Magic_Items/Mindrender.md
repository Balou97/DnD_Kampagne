## Profile

**Description:**Â 
This sinister-looking greatsword pulses with an eerie, otherworldly energy. The blade itself is forged from a dark, gleaming steel that seems to drink in the light around it. Slightly curved and exquisitely balanced, it is both beautiful and terrifying in its design.

Intricate arcane runes are carved into the blade, glowing faintly with a ghostly blue light. These runes seem to shift and change when viewed from different angles, creating an illusion of movement, as if the blade itself were alive and whispering secrets from the void. The glow of the runes intensifies with the wielder's emotions, flaring brightly during moments of intense concentration or anger.

## Powers:
#### Mind Rending:
You can use a bonus action to activate the mind rending feature. When activated, for the next minute, each time you successfully hit a target with Mindrender, the target must make an Intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target takes an extra 2d6 psychic damage, or half as much on a successful save.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest.
