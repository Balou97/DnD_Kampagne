## Profile

**Description:**Â 
Pidlewick II is an extraordinary figure, a mechanical servant originally crafted to serve Rahadin, the notorious right hand of Strahd von Zarovich. Standing just over three feet tall, Pidlewick II is a marvel of engineering and dark magic, resembling a clockwork automaton dressed in fine, if slightly antiquated, servant's attire. His expressive, if somewhat unsettling, face is adorned with delicately painted features, and his eyes, though artificial, seem to possess a keen intelligence and awareness.

Following the demise of his master Rahadin, Pidlewick II found himself without purpose or direction, a relic of a bygone era. Fate, however, had other plans. The adventuring party known as the Deam, who had brought about Rahadin's downfall, recognized the unique skills and potential within the mechanical servant. They offered him a new role as the manager of their newly acquired tavern, the Davern, as well as their other venture, the Demepark. Eager for a new beginning and driven by an intrinsic need to serve, Pidlewick II accepted.

In his new role, Pidlewick II has proven invaluable. His meticulous nature and unwavering dedication ensure that the Davern runs smoothly, from the quality of the ale to the comfort of the guests. He oversees the staff with precision, ensuring that every patron is treated with the utmost care and respect. At the Demepark, a whimsical and adventurous property owned by the Deam, Pidlewick II's organizational prowess shines, coordinating events and maintaining the various attractions with clockwork efficiency. Despite his mechanical nature, Pidlewick II has become a beloved figure among the Deam and their patrons, embodying a bridge between a dark past and a hopeful future.
