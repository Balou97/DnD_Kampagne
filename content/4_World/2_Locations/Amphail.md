## Profile

**Description:** 
Amphail is a quaint village nestled within the verdant landscape of the Dessarin Valley, just a few days' journey east of Waterdeep along the Long Road. Known for its picturesque surroundings and rustic charm, Amphail serves as a tranquil retreat from the bustling life of the Sword Coast’s grand cities. The village is named after the famous horse breeder Amphail the Just, and it remains renowned for its magnificent horses, which are highly sought after by nobles and merchants alike. The annual Horse Fair is a notable event, drawing visitors from far and wide to admire and purchase the exquisite breeds.

Despite its serene appearance, Amphail holds a rich tapestry of history and intrigue. The village is dotted with stately manors and farms, many of which belong to noble families from Waterdeep who maintain second homes in the countryside. The locals are known for their hospitality and deep connection to the land, living a lifestyle that balances farming, horse breeding, and small-scale trade. The village square is a hub of activity, featuring a variety of shops, an inn, and a blacksmith’s forge, all catering to the needs of travelers and residents. Overseeing this tranquil yet bustling community is Mayor Cedric Thornbury, a wise and approachable leader who ensures the safety and prosperity of Amphail through fair governance and a deep commitment to his people.

The surrounding area of Amphail is characterized by rolling hills, fertile fields, and dense woodlands, offering ample opportunities for hunting, foraging, and exploration. The village is also a starting point for adventurers heading into the wilds of the Sword Coast, providing a safe haven where they can rest and resupply. Despite its proximity to Waterdeep, Amphail maintains a distinct identity, marked by its pastoral beauty, storied heritage, and the unyielding spirit of its inhabitants.
