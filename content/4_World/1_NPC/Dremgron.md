## Profile

**Description:**Â 
Dremgron is the leader of one of the packs of kobolds that got sent out by their master to collect Gold from all over the kingdom. After he started working for the Deam he brought more and more of his Kobolds to the Deampark to cut down all the trees. In that process they also started to dig holes to the ground and build a tunnel system down south to their masters lair.
