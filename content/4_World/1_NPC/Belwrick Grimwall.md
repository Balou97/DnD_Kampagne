## Profile

**Description:**Â 
Belwrick Grimwall is a Halfling Rogue known for his insatiable appetite for easy gold, often at the expense of angering those bigger and stronger than him. Standing just over three feet tall, his unassuming stature belies a sharp wit and nimble fingers. Belwrick's early years were spent honing his skills in petty theft and trickery, always seeking the quickest route to riches. This audacious approach led him to the Zhentarim, the infamous Black Network, where he hoped to elevate his criminal activities. However, his tenure with the organization was short-lived. After pilfering valuable artifacts from a high-ranking member, he found himself expelled and hunted by his former allies.

Undeterred by this setback, Belwrick delved into the arcane arts, seeking to augment his roguish talents with magical prowess. He became adept at weaving spells that complemented his thievery, from illusions to conceal his presence to enchantments that unlocked even the most stubborn locks. This newfound knowledge only fueled his ambitions, allowing him to execute more daring heists. His latest adventure brought him to Waterdeep, where he stumbled upon an abandoned Zhentarim safehouse. The once-bustling hub of illicit activity was now eerily silent, the Black Network seemingly driven out by a powerful and unknown entity.

Belwrick has taken advantage of the safehouse's vacancy, using it as a temporary base to plot his next moves. With the Zhentarim's presence in Waterdeep diminished, he sees an opportunity to carve out his own niche in the city's underworld. Despite the looming threat of whatever force ousted the Zhentarim, Belwrick is driven by the thrill of the score and the promise of gold. In the shadowy corners of Waterdeep, he continues to weave his schemes, ever the daring rogue with a knack for turning misfortune into opportunity.
