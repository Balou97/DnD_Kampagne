## Profile

**Description:**Â 
Krezk is a small, somber village nestled in the shadow of the towering mountains of Barovia. Governed by the dark lord Strahd, the village is characterized by a quiet, eerie tranquility that belies its underlying despair. The streets are often muddy and poorly maintained, with simple wooden houses showing signs of wear and neglect. The air is heavy with a sense of gloom, and the villagers, few in number, go about their daily routines with a palpable sense of resignation. Life here is harsh and unremarkable, with little in the way of economic activity or entertainment.

The village is surrounded by a dense forest, adding to its isolation and bleakness. Krezk's most notable feature is the Abbey of Saint Markovia, perched on a hill overlooking the village, which serves as both a place of sanctuary and a reminder of the ever-present darkness in the land. Despite its peaceful facade, Krezk is a place where hope seems scarce, and the oppressive rule of Strahd casts a long, inescapable shadow over the lives of its inhabitants.
