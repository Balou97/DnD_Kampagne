## Profile

**Description:**Â 
Deampark, the newly acquired property of the Deam, is a serene expanse of land situated between Waterdeep and Amphail. Dominated by towering pine trees and gentle hills, it exudes a tranquil, untouched beauty. A crystal-clear river winds through the landscape, serving as a natural border and providing a refreshing water source. Though currently undeveloped, the lush greenery and the soothing sounds of the flowing river suggest great potential for a future haven or bustling settlement amidst the serene wilderness.
