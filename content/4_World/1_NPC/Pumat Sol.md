## Profile

**Description:**Â 
Pumat Sol, the genial tortle wizard who presides over "[[The Arcane Eye]]," embodies a timeless wisdom and serene demeanor that belies his magical prowess. His shell, weathered by centuries of arcane study, holds deep blue-green hues that shimmer faintly under the ambient glow of enchanted artifacts within his shop. His eyes, sharp and perceptive, seem to hold a glint of otherworldly knowledge, reflecting a lifetime spent unraveling the mysteries of magic and enchantment.

Clad in robes adorned with intricate runes and symbols, Pumat Sol moves with a measured grace that speaks of both scholarly discipline and a tranquil inner strength. His voice, a soothing baritone, resonates with warmth and genuine interest as he imparts wisdom to seekers of arcane lore and offers counsel on the powerful artifacts that line his expansive shelves. Pumat Sol's presence is augmented by the presence of magically crafted duplicates of himself, identical in every mannerism and appearance, which efficiently manage his shops across the realm simultaneously, ensuring each maintains the same level of expertise and hospitality that defines "The Arcane Eye".
