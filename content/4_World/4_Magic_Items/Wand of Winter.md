## Profile

**Description:**Â 
Crafted from frost-covered wood and capped with a shimmering sapphire, it holds within it the essence of winter itself. When wielded, the wand allows its bearer to unleash blasts of cold energy, conjure swirling storms of snow and ice, and even freeze adversaries in their tracks. It embodies the raw and relentless force of winter, making it both a formidable weapon and a symbol of the chilling beauty of the season.

## Powers:
The wand has 7 charges, which are used to fuel the spells within it. With the wand in hand, you can use your action to cast one of the following spells from the wand, even if you are incapable of casting spells: [[ray-of-frost]] (no charges, or 1 charge to cast at 5th level; +5 to hit with ranged spell attack), [[sleet-storm]] (3 charges; spell save DC 15), or [[ice-storm]] (4 charges; spell save DC 15). No components are required. The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges each day at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 20, the wand melts away, forever destroyed.
