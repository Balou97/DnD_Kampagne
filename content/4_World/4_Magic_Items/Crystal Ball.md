## Profile

**Description:**Â 
This elegantly crafted crystal ball is a sphere of flawless quartz, about six inches in diameter, with an ethereal glow that pulses gently when held. While casting, the crystal ball's glow intensifies, revealing swirling mists within that gradually form the image of the target.

## Powers:
While touching it, you can cast the [[scrying]] spell (save DC 17) with it.
