## Profile

**Description:**Â 
Artor Morlin is a vampire who lives in the deep shadows of the sewers of Waterdeep. Once human, his transformation has endowed him with a sinister aura and an eerie presence. Despite his unsettling nature, he possesses a quiet dignity and remarkable knowledge, particularly in occult and alchemical studies. His eyes glow with a sharp red hue.

Artor rarely emerges to the surface and prefers to remain in darkness. He dresses in long, dark robes that make his movements soundless. His voice is deep and gentle, creating a fascinating contrast to his terrifying appearance. In his rare encounters with the residents of Waterdeep, he always appears polite and controlled, yet a sense of latent threat accompanies him.

A silent agreement between Artor and the authorities of Waterdeep maintains a fragile balance. Artor has agreed not to kill humans for their blood, and in return, he receives regular deliveries of animal blood. This arrangement allows him to continue his eerie studies undisturbed in the depths of the sewers. Rumors suggest that his research delves into long-forgotten secrets of magic and alchemy, denied to him when he was human.
