## Profile

**Description:**Â 
Thereon Aelnor, a brilliant scientist, was, together with Dr. Dr. Jarvis, the leader of the science department in Oribos. Springwater tasked the scientists in Oribos with creating an army of combat robots to defend the realm of Lemuria. Jarvis and Thereon spent years researching and ultimately developed a mechanical super warrior.

Once the first prototypes were delivered to Springwater, modifications were demanded, such as disabling autonomous thinking and ensuring 100% control of the machines by a single person. Additional weapons were also to be implemented.

Thereon suspected that the robots would be used for purposes beyond defense and resisted these directives. This led to a conflict with Jarvis, and in the end, Thereon tried to destroy all the robots but was stopped by Jarvis.

With most of the robots destroyed and Thereon no longer cooperating, Springwater sent their army to destroy Oribos. Thereon activated the last two robots to escape. Jarvis was taken back to Springwater, where he continued working on new inventions. The city of Oribos is now a deserted ruin. One of the two robots was destroyed during the escape.

Thereon and FEND set up a small workshop/laboratory near a small village under the pseudonym Uldon Bryn. One day, Thereon left for Oribos but never returned.
